### What is Prompt Lockbox ? 

As language models become central to our applications, the prompts that control them are often treated as an afterthought—scattered across code, text files, and documents. This chaos leads to **inconsistency**, **lost work**, and a **lack of security** for your most critical AI assets.

Prompt Lockbox is a **command-line tool** and **Python SDK** designed to fix this. It provides a professional framework for bringing **structure**, **security**, and **version-controlled** management to your entire prompt engineering workflow, transforming your prompts from simple text into robust, reliable, and manageable code.

<Tip>
  **Quick Tip!**
  As all project configuration and state are stored in centralized files, you can use the CLI or SDK interchangeably. Actions performed with one are immediately reflected when using the other.
</Tip>


### What problems does it solve ?

Here’s what it fixes for you -

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scattered Prompts Problem"> 
      - **Problem**: Your team's best prompts are lost in a chaotic mess of text files, Slack messages, and Google Docs. No one knows where the "official" version is, leading to confusion and duplicated effort
      - **Solution**: It creates a centralized and structured library, making it effortless for your entire team to find and use the correct prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which Version Was That? Problem">
    - **Problem**: You tweak a great prompt and accidentally make it worse, with no way to go back to the version that worked.
    - **Solution**: It provides Git-like versioning for prompts. Safely create new versions and manage modifications, just like code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Did Someone Change This? Problem">
    - **Problem**: A critical prompt is changed without approval, breaking your application and causing unpredictable outputs..
    - **Solution**: It lets you lock and secure key prompts. The system instantly detects any unauthorized edits, ensuring production reliability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reinventing the Wheel Problem">
    - **Problem**: Your team wastes time building prompts that already exist because they're impossible to find.
    - **Solution**: It makes your entire library instantly searchable. Find what you need in seconds with powerful, context-aware search.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Good Prompt, Bad Documentation Problem">
    - **Problem**: You write a brilliant prompt but have no time to document it, making it unusable for others (or your future self).
    - **Solution**: It uses AI to automate documentation. One command generates a clear description and search tags, turning your prompts into reusable assets.
  </Accordion>

### Prompt Format
Let's have a quick look on how it creates an awesome prompt.

```python
project = Project()

new_prompt = project.create_prompt(
  name="Email-agent",
  version="1.0.0",
  description="Create a persuasive email template for small tech business owners to promote a chatbot product.",
  namespace=["email-tools", "ai-agent"],
  tags=[
      "email",
      "persuasive",
      "small business",
      "tech industry",
      "chatbot"
  ],
  author="ananya868 <ananya8154@gmail.com>",
  intended_model="gpt-9",
  model_parameters={
      "temperature": 0.7
  },
  linked_prompts=[
      "email-monitor-agent",
      "client-scrapper-agent"
  ],
  notes="Do not use in production before testing!"
)
```
We've created a prompt template with metadata. Go ahead and plug in your actual prompt—here’s what it looks like:

className="rounded-lg"
