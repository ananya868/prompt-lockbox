## **Framework-Base Features** 

### 1. Security & Access Control
*   **Immutable Prompt Lock:** Once locked, a prompt version cannot be altered, ensuring integrity.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles (e.g., viewer, editor, approver) for prompt access and management.
*   **API Key Management:** Generate and revoke API keys for programmatic access to the prompt library.
*   **Secrets Vault Integration:** Pull sensitive data (API keys, DB passwords) into prompts at runtime from a secure vault.
*   **Audit Trail:** Log every access, modification, and execution attempt for full accountability.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Store and transmit all prompts in an encrypted format.

### 2. Management & Versioning
*   **Semantic Versioning (v1.2.0):** Enforce structured versioning for every prompt change, with support for major/minor/patch.
*   **Centralized Prompt Registry:** A single, searchable source of truth for all prompts in your organization.
*   **Tagging & Metadata:** Add custom tags (e.g., `marketing`, `code-gen`, `pii-scrubbing`) for easy discovery.
*   **Prompt Templating Engine:** Use a standard syntax (like Jinja2) for creating reusable prompts with variables.
*   **Dependency Declaration:** Formally link prompts that depend on each other (e.g., a summarizer prompt that uses a classification prompt first).
*   **Archival & Deprecation Lifecycle:** Mark prompts as deprecated or archive them to clean up the library without losing history.
*   **Flags** Active, Inactive, Waste, Old, New, etc.

### 3. Development & Optimization
*   **Interactive Prompt IDE/Playground:** A web interface or IDE plugin to build and test prompts in real-time.
*   **AI-Powered Enhancer:** Suggests improvements for clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness based on LLM best practices.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Natively support running two prompt versions against each other to compare performance.
*   **Cost & Latency Estimator:** Provide an estimate of token cost and API latency before running a prompt.
*   **Unit Testing for Prompts:** Define test cases with expected outputs to validate prompt behavior on change.
*   **Semantic Search Library:** Find existing prompts based on what they do, not just keywords.

### 4. Collaboration & Documentation
*   **Approval Workflows:** Require a review and approval process before a prompt can be published to a production environment.
*   **In-line Commenting:** Allow team members to leave comments and suggestions directly on prompt drafts.
*   **Auto-Generated "Prompt Card":** Create a one-page, shareable summary for any prompt, detailing its purpose, variables, and version history.
*   **Shared Team Workspaces:** Group prompts, collaborators, and analytics by team or project.
*   **Change History Diff Viewer:** Visually compare two versions of a prompt to see exactly what has changed.

### 5. Tracking & Analytics
*   **Performance Dashboard:** Track key metrics like response quality (via user feedback), latency, and cost over time.
*   **Model Drift Detection:** Monitor for changes in model output for a fixed prompt and alert on significant deviations.
*   **Usage Analytics:** Show which applications or users are calling which prompts and how often.
*   **Feedback Loop API:** Provide an endpoint to log user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) on model responses.
*   **Error & Failure Logging:** Automatically log and categorize prompts that result in API errors or poor-quality responses.

### 6. Integration & Deployment (New Section)
*   **Python SDK:** A simple `pip install` library to fetch and execute prompts securely from any Python app.
*   **REST API:** Provide API endpoints so non-Python environments can access the prompt lockbox.
*   **CI/CD Hooks:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automatically test and deploy new prompt versions.
*   **Environment Management:** Support distinct environments (dev, staging, prod) with different active prompt versions.
*   **Model-Agnostic Connectors:** A pluggable architecture to connect to various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, local models).
