This is the core loop of using Prompt Lockbox. This guide will walk you through the entire lifecycle of a single prompt: **from its initial creation as a draft, to securing it, and finally to creating a new version for safe iteration.**

### Steps 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Prompt">
    We'll start by creating a new prompt for a "Joke Generator". The create command builds a new, compliant `.yml` file for you.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="CLI">
        ```bash
        # Interactive prompt creation
        plb create
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from prompt_lockbox.api import Project
        
        project = Project()
        # create_prompt() builds the file and returns a Prompt object
        joke_prompt = project.create_prompt(
            name="joke-generator",
            description="Creates a dad joke on a given topic.",
            tags=["humor", "dad-joke"]
        )
        print(f"Created: {joke_prompt.path}")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit and Finalize">
    Now, open the newly created `prompts/joke-generator.v1.0.0.yml` file and **add your template content**. This is the only manual step in the process.

    ```yml
    template: |
      Tell me a dad joke about {{topic}}.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock for Production">
    Once you're happy with `v1.0.0`, **lock it**. This marks the prompt as "production-ready," records its secure hash, and protects it from accidental changes.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="CLI">
        ```bash
        plb lock joke-generator
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from prompt_lockbox.api import Project
        
        project = Project()
        prompt_to_lock = project.get_prompt("joke-generator")
        
        prompt_to_lock.lock()
        print(f"Locked: {prompt_to_lock.name}")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    <Info>
      You can verify the prompt's new status by running `plb status`. You'll see joke-generator is now marked as `âœ” Locked`.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Version">
    Let's say you want to improve the joke prompt. Instead of editing the locked file, you create a new version. This preserves the original v1.0.0 and gives you a safe, unlocked copy to work on.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="CLI">
        ```bash
        plb version joke-generator --minor
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from prompt_lockbox.api import Project
        
        project = Project()
        source_prompt = project.get_prompt("joke-generator")
        if source_prompt:
            new_version_prompt = source_prompt.new_version(
                bump_type="minor"
            )
            print(f"Created new version: {new_version_prompt.path}")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    This creates a new file, `prompts/joke-generator.v1.1.0.yml`. You are now free to edit this new version without affecting the locked original.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

You have now learned how to create, secure, and safely iterate on the prompt. This workflow is fundamental to maintaining a reliable and organized prompt library.
