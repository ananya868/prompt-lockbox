template: |
  Draft a compelling email targeting small tech business owners (e.g., startups or established tech companies) to promote a specific product like a {{product}}. The email should maintain a friendly yet professional tone and focus on the advantages of the product. Incorporate the following structure:
  1. Subject Line: Craft a catchy and relevant line, such as 'Transform Your Business with Our Cutting-Edge Chatbot' or 'Discover How Our Chatbot Can Engage Your Customers 24/7'.
  2. Opening: Start with a warm greeting and a brief introduction that addresses the readerâ€™s industry and needs.
  3. Body: Clearly outline the benefits of the chatbot, addressing common pain points like customer engagement or operational efficiency. Include specific examples, statistics, and a success story or testimonial from a satisfied client who experienced tangible results after implementing the chatbot.
  4. Call to Action: Encourage them to take action, such as scheduling a demo or visiting the website for more information.
  5. Closing: End with a friendly sign-off, including your contact information, and invite them to reach out with any questions.
