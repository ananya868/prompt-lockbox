As your library grows, finding the right prompt becomes critical. Prompt Lockbox provides several powerful tools to discover and navigate your collection.

Methods:

### List all Prompts

The list command is perfect for getting a quick, high-level overview of your entire library. The default view is compact, while the `--wide` flag provides more detail.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
      # For a compact view
      plb list
      
      # For a more detailed view
      plb list --wide
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
      from prompt_lockbox import Project
      from rich import print
      
      project = Project()
      
      # The list_prompts() method returns a list of Prompt objects
      all_prompts = project.list_prompts()
      
      for p in all_prompts:
          print(
            f"Name: {p.name}, Version: {p.version}, Status: {p.data.get('status')}"
          )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Search for a Specific Prompt

When your library is large, direct search is the fastest way to find what you need. The default `fuzzy` search is fast, requires no setup, and intelligently searches `names`, `descriptions`, and `tags`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    # Find any prompt that mentions "joke"
    plb search fuzzy "joke"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from prompt_lockbox.api import Project
    from rich import print
    
    project = Project()
    
    # The search() method returns a list of result dictionaries
    search_results = project.search(query="joke", method="fuzzy")
    
    print(search_results)
    # [
    #   {'score': 90, 'name': 'joke-generator', ...},
    #   ...
    # ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### The Organized Tree

If you've organized your prompts with `namespaces` (e.g., namespace: [agents, support]), the `tree` command visualizes your library in a familiar, folder-like structure. This is the best way to browse prompts by category.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    # Display the hierarchical tree
    plb tree
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Output:

```shell
🥡 Prompt Library
├── 🗂️ agents 
│   └── 🗂️ support
│       └── 📄 customer-support-agent.v1.0.0.yml
├── 🗂️ generators
│   └── 📄 joke-generator.v1.0.0.yml
└── 📄 sql-generator.v1.0.0.yml (No Namespace)
```

<Note>
  The tree command is purely a CLI visualization tool and does not have a direct SDK equivalent, as the SDK's list_prompts() method provides the raw data needed to build any custom tree structure programmatically.
</Note>

### Next Steps

You now know the three primary ways to find prompts in your library. You can get a quick overview with list, browse by category with tree, and pinpoint exactly what you need with search. A discoverable library is a reusable library.
