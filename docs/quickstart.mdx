**Prompt Lockbox is quite easy to install**. Its available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/) index, so all you need is a python package installer [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)\!

<Note>
**Supported Python version**: `> 3.10`
</Note>

## How to install ?

You can directly install the toolkit using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or from our [github repo](https://github.com/ananya868/prompt-lockbox/tree/main).

<Warning>
  It is advised to **create a new virtual environment** to avoid any unnecessary package conflict.
</Warning>

Install using command -

```bash
pip install prompt-lockbox
```

This will setup Prompt Lockbox and all related dependencies.

Alternatively -

<Accordion title="Install from GitHub repo" icon="github">
  Navigate to your local directory, open command pallete and **clone the repo using** -

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ananya868/prompt-lockbox.git
  ```

  Then install the toolkit using pip -

  ```bash
  pip install -e prompt-lockbox/ 
  ```

  This will install the package in your python environment.
</Accordion>

Setup is done. We can now create a new Prompt Lockbox Project \!

## Create a new project

The first step is to create a project, which is nothing but **setting up the necessary directories and configuration files** for you.

To do this, **we will use CLI for this guide**. Well, you can also use the SDK for these tasks, checkout [SDK](/api-reference/sdk_reference). In your project directory, run -

```bash
plb init . 
```

This command will initialize a Prompt Lockbox project and build these files -

- **prompts/**: The directory where all your versioned .yml prompt files will live.
- **.plb/**: A hidden directory for internal data in toolkit like search indexes, logs etc.
- **plb.toml**: The main configuration file for your project. You can use it to set project-wide settings, like the AI model for automated tasks.
- **.plb.lock**: The lockfile that stores the secure hashes of your production-ready prompts, protecting them from unauthorized changes.

We have created a Project. Now we can start building prompts \!

### Create a Prompt

Now that we have our project, let's create our first prompt. We'll use the interactive `create` command, which guides you through setting up all the required metadata.

In your terminal, run -

```bash
plb create 
```

Answer the entries as required. For most, you can just press Enter to accept the default value.

Let's say prompt name is **'Customer-support-agent'**. The `create` command creates a new file named `prompts/Customer-support-agent.v1.0.0.yml`.

Hurray\! You have created your first prompt. **But note that its just a template and the actual content and other metadata should be filled by the user.**

### Template

Here are two templates for your reference â€” one is blank, and the other is a completed customer support agent prompt template with content and metadata -

      2. Opening: Greet the reader and mention a common support challenge.
      3. Body: Highlight how the product improves response time, reduces workload, and boosts customer satisfaction. Add a brief success story or stat.
      4. Call to Action: Invite them to book a demo or try it out.
      5. Closing: Sign off warmly with contact info.

The `create` command builds an empty template. Open the `prompts/Customer-support-agent.v1.0.0.yml` file in your code editor. **Find the template: key and replace the placeholder content with the filled example above or write your own !** 


### Run the prompt

<Warning>
  LLM configuration is required for this step. While the toolkit itself is not LLM-dependent, some features rely on it. Please [configure LLM](www.google.com) before proceeding.
</Warning>

Let's execute our prompt using the `run` command. The command will see the required variables and ask you for them.

**It will run the prompt against a LLM of your choice**. Checkout [LLMs](www.google.com) to find a list of supported models. 

In your terminal, run -

```bash
plb run Customer-support-agent gpt-4.1-nano 
```
It will render the filled prompt and the output generated using the specified LLM.
