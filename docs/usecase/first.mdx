As your prompt library becomes a critical part of your application, you need to treat it with the same rigor as your source code. Manually checking every prompt before deployment is tedious and error-prone.

This guide will show you **how to build an automated quality gate for your prompts using GitHub Actions**. This workflow will automatically run on every Pull Request, ensuring that no broken, malformed, or tampered-with prompts can ever be merged into your main branch.

<Info>
  **The Goal**: To create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically:

  1. Lints all prompts to check for syntax and schema errors.
  2. Verifies the integrity of all locked prompts to prevent unauthorized changes.

  If either of these checks fails, the pipeline will fail, blocking the Pull Request from being merged.
</Info>

## The Key Commands

This entire workflow is powered by two key Prompt Lockbox commands that are designed for automation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lint">
    The `plb lint` command scans every single .yml file in your `prompts/` directory. It checks for a wide range of issues, including:

    - Invalid YAML syntax.
    - Missing required fields (like `name` or `version`).
    - Incorrect data types (e.g., a string where a list should be).
    - Invalid `Jinja2` syntax in your templates.

    If it finds any critical errors, it will exit with a non-zero status code `(1)`, which is the signal that tells a CI/CD system to fail the job.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify">
    The `plb verify` command is your security guard. It reads your project's `.plb.lock` file and compares the stored secure hashes against the current hashes of the files on disk.

    It specifically checks for two dangerous conditions:

    - **A TAMPERED file**: A prompt that is locked but has been modified.
    - **A MISSING file**: A prompt that is locked but has been deleted.

    If it finds either of these issues, it will exit with a status code of `1`, failing the CI/CD job and protecting your production environment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting Up the GitHub Workflow

Now, let's put these commands together in an automated workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Workflow File">
    In your project's root directory, create a new folder path: `.github/workflows/`. Inside that workflows folder, create a new file named `prompt_qa.yml`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Workflow Content">
    Copy and paste the following content into your `prompt_qa.yml file`. This YAML **defines a GitHub Actions job** that will **run on every pull request** targeting your main branch.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```yaml .github/workflows/prompt_qa.yml
    name: Prompt Quality Assurance
    
    # This workflow runs on every pull request that targets the 'main' branch
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]
      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:
    
    jobs:
      validate-prompts:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          # Step 1: Check out your repository's code
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
          # Step 2: Set up Python so we can install and run our tool
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: '3.11'
    
          # Step 3: Install Prompt Lockbox and any other dependencies
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install prompt-lockbox
    
          # Step 4: Run the Linter
            run: plb lint
    
          # Step 5: Verify Integrity of Locked Prompts
          - name: Verify Locked Prompts
            run: plb verify 
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit and Push">
    **Commit** the `prompt_qa.yml` file and **push** it to your repository.

    <Check>
      **Automation is Now Active\!**

      That's it\! From now on, whenever someone opens a Pull Request, GitHub will automatically run these checks. You'll see a new "Prompt Quality Assurance" check on your PR page. If it passes, you'll get a `green checkmark`. If it fails, you'll get a `red "X"`, and you can click "Details" to see the output from `plb lint` or `plb verify` to understand what went wrong.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

By integrating these simple commands into a CI/CD pipeline, you elevate your prompt management from a manual process to a professional, automated system. This provides a powerful safety net, giving your ensurance that your prompts remain stable, secure, and reliable.
