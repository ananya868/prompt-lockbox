When you're working on a team, managing a shared library of prompts can quickly become chaotic. Who wrote this prompt? Is it ready for production? Which prompts are for the billing system versus the support chatbot?

This guide provides a blueprint for using Prompt Lockbox's organizational features to create a clean, collaborative, and easy-to-navigate prompt library for your team.

<Info>
  **The Goal**: To establish a clear, consistent, and scalable workflow for teams by leveraging:

  Namespaces for organization.

  - The **Status** field for tracking a prompt's lifecycle.
  - The **Author** field for ownership.
</Info>

## Organizing Prompts with Namespaces

The `namespace` field is a tool for bringing order to your library. Think of it like a folder path. **By assigning a namespace to each prompt, you can group them by feature, domain, or team responsibility.**

### How to use ?

When creating a prompt, just define its namespace as a list of strings in your `.yml` file.

Example:

<CodeGroup>

```yml prompts/invoice-parser.v1.0.0.yml
name: invoice-parser
namespace: [billing, invoices]
description: "Parses details from an uploaded invoice PDF."
...
```


```yml prompts/triage-ticket.v1.2.0.yml
name: triage-ticket
namespace: [support, triage]
description: "Categorizes an incoming support ticket."
...
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Establish a consistent naming convention for your namespaces early on. For example, [feature, sub-feature] or [domain, action].
</Tip>

### Visualizing the Structure with plb tree

Once your prompts are namespaced, `the plb tree` command becomes incredibly useful. It displays your library in a clean, hierarchical view, making it easy for anyone on the team to find what they need.

```bash
plb tree
```

## Tracking the Prompt Lifecycle with status

The **status** field helps your team understand the maturity and intended use of each prompt. It prevents a half-finished "draft" prompt from accidentally being used in production.

### The Standard Lifecycle

Here is a typical workflow using the status field:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Draft">
    When a prompt is first created, its status is `Draft`. This means it's a work-in-progress and not ready for use.

    ```yaml
    status: "Draft"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. In-Review">
    Once the author thinks the prompt is `ready`, they change the status to In-Review and open a Pull Request. This signals to other team members that it's ready for peer review.

    ```yaml
    status: "In-Review"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Staging">
    After the review is approved, the prompt might be moved to `Staging`. This means it's deployed to a testing or staging environment for final validation.

    ```yaml
    status: "Staging"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Production">
    Once it's validated in staging, the prompt is moved to `Production` status and locked using `plb lock`. This is the final, trusted version.

    ```yaml
    status: "Production"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Deprecated/Archived">
    If a prompt is no longer needed or has been replaced by a newer version, its status can be set to `Deprecated` or `Archived` to signal that it should not be used in new development.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Viewing Statuses at a Glance

The `plb list --wide` command is perfect for getting a quick overview of the status of all prompts in the library.

```bash
plb list --wide 
```

### Set Author

In a team setting, knowing who to talk to about a specific prompt is essential. The author field solves this. When you run `plb create` or `plb version` in a Git repository, Prompt Lockbox **automatically fills this field with your Git user name and email**. Example:

```yaml
author: "Ada lang <adalang@example.com" 
```

By combining namespaces for organization, the status field for lifecycle tracking, and the author field for ownership, these features provide the structure needed to manage prompts effectively as your projects.
