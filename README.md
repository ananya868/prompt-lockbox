## Why use it ?

Managing prompts across a team or a large project can be chaotic. Plain text files lack versioning, are prone to accidental changes, and have no built-in quality control. **Prompt Lockbox** turns your prompts from fragile text files into versioned assets.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the common pain points it solves:

| The Pain Point                                                                       | The Prompt Lockbox Solution                                                                  | Key Command(s)                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scattered Prompts**<br/>Prompts are lost across text files, Slack, and Google Docs. | Provides a centralized, version-controlled library for all prompts.                          | `plb init`, `plb list`, `plb tree`               |
| **Untracked Changes**<br/>A great prompt is made worse with no easy way to revert.    | Treats prompts like code with built-in semantic versioning.                                  | `plb version`                                    |
| **Unsafe Edits**<br/>Critical production prompts are modified without approval.       | Locks production-ready prompts to prevent unauthorized edits and detects tampering.          | `plb lock`, `plb unlock`, `plb verify`           |
| **Hard to Discover**<br/>Teams waste time reinventing prompts that are hard to find.  | Makes the entire library instantly searchable with fuzzy, hybrid, and sparse-vector search. | `plb index`, `plb search <method>`               |
| **Poor Documentation**<br/>Writing and maintaining documentation is tedious and skipped. | Uses AI to automate documentation, generating descriptions and tags in seconds.                | `plb prompt document`                            |

## Features

*   **Integrity & Security:** Lock prompts to generate a checksum. The `plb verify` command ensures that production prompts haven't been tampered with since they were last approved.

*   **Version Control First:** Automatically create new, semantically versioned prompt files with `plb version`, making it easy to iterate and experiment safely without breaking existing implementations.

*   **AI features:**
    *   **Auto-Documentation:** `plb prompt document` uses an AI to analyze your prompt and generate a concise description and relevant search tags.
    *   **Auto-Improvement:** `plb prompt improve` provides an expert critique and a suggested, improved version of your prompt template, showing you a diff of the changes.
    *   **Direct Execution:** Execute prompts directly against your configured LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, HuggingFace) right from the CLI.

*   **Advanced Search:** Don't just `grep`. Build a local search index (`hybrid` TF-IDF + FAISS or `splade`) to find the right prompt instantly using natural language queries.

*   **Flexible Configuration:** An interactive wizard (`plb configure-ai`) makes it trivial to set up any provider and model, securely storing API keys in a local `.env` file.

## Installation

### **Using pip:**

The base toolkit can be installed directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install prompt-lockbox
```

To include support for specific AI providers or features, install the optional "extras". You can combine multiple extras in one command.

```bash
# To use OpenAI models
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[openai]'

# To use HuggingFace models (includes torch)
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[huggingface]'

# To use the advanced search features (includes faiss-cpu)
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[search]'

# To install everything
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[all]'
```

### **Using this repo:**
   
If you want to install the very latest development version directly from the repository, you can use `pip` with a Git URL. This is useful for testing upcoming features before they are released on PyPI.

```bash
# Install the latest version from the main branch
pip install git+https://github.com/ananya868/prompt-lockbox.git

# To include optional dependencies, you must add them as a comma-separated list
# Example: Installing with support for OpenAI and Search
pip install "prompt-lockbox[openai,search] @ git+https://github.com/ananya868/prompt-lockbox.git"
```

## Quickstart: Your First 5 Minutes

This guide takes you from an empty directory to executing your first AI-powered prompt.

**1. Initialize Your Project**
Create a directory and run `init`. This sets up the required file structure.

```bash
mkdir my-prompt-project && cd my-prompt-project
plb init
```

**2. Configure Your AI Provider**
Run the interactive wizard to connect to your preferred LLM provider. It will securely save your API keys to a local `.env` file.

```bash
# This launches the interactive setup wizard
plb configure-ai
```

**3. Create Your First Prompt**
The `create` command will guide you through making a new prompt file.

```bash
# This launches an interactive prompt creation wizard
plb create
```
Follow the steps to name your prompt (e.g., "email-formatter"). Now, open the new file at `prompts/email-formatter.v1.0.0.yml` and add your template logic.

**4. Run and Execute**
Test your prompt by rendering it with variables, then execute it with the `--execute` flag to get a live AI response.

```bash
# Render the prompt template with a variable
plb run email-formatter --var user_request="draft a polite follow-up email"

# Send the rendered prompt to your configured AI for a response
plb run email-formatter --var user_request="draft a polite follow-up email" --execute
```

**Package Breakdown**: 

Here is a high-level breakdown of the purpose of each main directory within the package:

| Directory | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ai/`**     | Handles all direct interactions with AI models. This is where `executor.py` lives, along with the logic for documentation and improvement. |
| **`cli/`**    | Contains all the Command-Line Interface logic. Each file corresponds to a `plb` command or command group, built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). |
| **`core/`**   | The internal engine of the toolkit. It contains low-level, non-user-facing functions for file integrity, prompt validation, and templating. |
| **`search/`** | Implements the advanced search backends (`fuzzy`, `hybrid`, `splade`). The heavy dependencies for these modules are loaded on-demand.  |
| **`ui/`**     | Dedicated to presentation logic. This module uses the [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to create beautiful terminal tables, panels, and trees. |
| **`api.py`**  | The primary public-facing SDK. It defines the high-level `Project` and `Prompt` classes that developers can import and use in their own Python code. |
